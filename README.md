# How This Tool Works

## A Marvel of 21st Century Technology

This tool operates on the following principle:

1. **You input numbers** - supposedly to get an answer.
2. **The calculator thinks** - in reality, it just performs basic math.
3. **A miracle happens** - two digits magically become one.
4. **You are amazed** - how is this even possible?

Thanks to advanced algorithms (addition, subtraction, and their friends), this revolutionary device can solve problems that humans have been solving for centuries. Mind-blowing! 🎩✨

## Advanced "Magical" Features

But that's not all! Our tool has even more powerful capabilities:

- **sin, cos, tan** - trigonometric spells that turn angles into mysterious numbers between -1 and 1.
- **log, ln** - logarithmic charms for those who love reversing exponents (Exponentiation not included).
- **sqrt** - the square root, or as we call it, "half a miracle" (DO NOT TAKE THIS TOO SERIOUSLY! IT MAY LEAD TO CONSEQUENCES AND SELF-PUNISHMENT WITH A WHIP).

All these functions work on the same magical principle: you input a number, the calculator whispers an incantation, and voilà, the result is ready. Physics? Math? No, just *magic* 🧙‍♂️

## ⚠️ Critical Safety Warning

**WARNING!** Using this calculator may lead to the following side effects:

- Sudden realization that 2+2=4 (dangerous for the psyche).
- Brain spasms from understanding that the square root of 9 is 3.
- A philosophical crisis: "Who even invented numbers?"
- Uncontrollable desire to count things in real life.
- Risk of becoming the person who says, "Actually, it's just a logarithm."

**If you notice these symptoms, immediately:**
1. Close the calculator.
2. Count sheep (but not using math).
3. Consult a doctor if the urge to count persists for more than 24 hours.

Remember: math is serious business. Use the calculator responsibly! 📐⚠️
